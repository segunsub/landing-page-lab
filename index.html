            <p>Local libraries are of course great resource for parents and kids. Pretty much every branch offers story hours, so you can probably find one right in your neighborhood. 
               They have lots of other great activities too, including plays, concerts, arts and crafts, and homework help. 
               Visit the NYPL website to find out what going on at your local branch or browse the Event Calendar for the entire NYPL.
